Introduction

Pylon is a port of MATPOWER_ to the Python programming language.  MATPOWER_ is
a Matlab package for solving power flow and optimal power flow problems.

:mod:`pylon <pylon>`
  Defines the :class:`Case <pylon.case.Case>`, :class:`Bus <pylon.case.Bus>`,
  :class:`Branch <pylon.case.Branch>` and :class:`Generator
  <pylon.generator.Generator>` classes and solvers for power flow and optimal
  power flow problems.

:mod:`pylon.readwrite <pylon.readwrite>`
  Parsers for power system data files with support for MATPOWER_, PSS/E, and
  PSAT_.  Also, defines case serializers for MATPOWER_, PSS/E, CSV and Excel
  formats.  Case reports are available in ReStructuredText_ format.

:mod:`pylon.test <pylon.test>`
  A comprehensive suite of unit tests.

This manual explains how to install Pylon and provides a series of tutorials
that show how to solve power flow and optimal power problems.
Pylon follows the design of MATPOWER_ closely and the `MATPOWER user
manual <http://www.pserc.cornell.edu/matpower/manual.pdf>`_ will likely provide
a useful reference.
