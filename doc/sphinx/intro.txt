Introduction

Pylon is a port of MATPOWER to the Python programming language.  MATPOWER is a Matlab package for solving power flow and optimal power flow problems.

:mod:`pylon <pylon>`
  Implements the MATPOWER power system model using the classes :class:`Bus <pylon.bus.Bus>`,  :class:`Branch <pylon.branch.Branch>` and :class:`Generator <pylon.generator.Generator>`.  Defines solvers for power flow and optimal power flow problems.  They are translated from MATPOWER_ using the sparse matrix types and solvers from CVXOPT_.

:mod:`pyreto <pyreto>`
  Defines PyBrain_ experiments for simulating competitive energy trade using reinforcement learning algorithms with artificial neural networks.

:mod:`pylon.readwrite <pylon.readwrite>`
  Parsers for a selection of power system data file formats including
  MATPOWER_, PSS/E, and PSAT_.
  Export of data in MATPOWER_, CSV and Excel file formats.
  Reports in ReStructuredText_ format.

:mod:`pylon.test <pylon.test>`
  A comprehensive suite of unit tests.

:mod:`pylontk` <pylontk>`
  Portable GUI with plots from Matplotlib_ and graph viualisation using NetworkX_.

This manual provides tutorials on simulating power systems and energy markets using Pylon.  Pylon contains solvers translated from MATPOWER_ and the `user manual <http://www.pserc.cornell.edu/matpower/manual.pdf>`_ is a useful reference.
